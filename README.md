# 311_Customer_Service_Requests_Analysis
## Introduction:
The New York City 311 service is dedicated to providing efficient and accessible government services and information to the public. This project focuses on performing a data analysis of the NYC 311 service request calls, aiming to gain insights into the patterns and trends within the dataset. By utilizing data wrangling techniques and visualization methods, we can explore the major complaint types, analyze response times, and examine the relationship between complaint types and locations.

## Data Exploration:
The dataset contains several fields such as Unique Key, Created Date, Closed Date, Agency, Complaint Type, Location Type, Incident Zip, Borough, and more. The "Created Date" and "Closed Date" columns were converted to datetime datatype to enable analysis based on time elapsed. Additionally, a new column called "Request_Closing_Time" was created to represent the duration between request creation and closure.

## Insights and Patterns:
1. Complaint Type Distribution: By analyzing the dataset, we can visualize the distribution of complaint types using graphs or tables. This allows us to identify the most common complaint types and their frequencies, helping prioritize resources for efficient service delivery.

2. Average Request Closing Time: By grouping complaint types based on location, we can calculate the average request closing time. This analysis enables us to identify complaint types that generally take longer to address and those that are resolved more quickly. The results can assist in resource allocation and process improvement.

3. Relationship between Complaint Types and Location: To determine whether the type of complaint or service requested is related to the location, a statistical test can be performed. This analysis helps understand if certain complaints are more prevalent in specific areas of the city, allowing targeted interventions and resource planning.

## Statistical Testing:
1. Average Response Time: A statistical test can be conducted to determine if the average response time across complaint types is similar or not. The null hypothesis (H0) would state that the average response times are equal for all complaint types, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) would suggest that they differ. By calculating the p-value, we can accept or reject the null hypothesis based on a predetermined significance level.

2. Relationship between Complaint Types and Location: Another statistical test can be performed to assess whether the type of complaint or service requested is related to the location. The null hypothesis (H0) would assume no association between the two variables, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) would suggest a significant relationship. By calculating the p-value, we can accept or reject the null hypothesis, indicating whether there is a statistically significant association.

## Conclusion:
In this data analysis project, we explored the NYC 311 service request calls dataset to gain insights into complaint patterns and response times. By converting and manipulating the data, we obtained the request closing time and analyzed the major complaint types. Through visualizations and statistical testing, we were able to identify significant patterns, prioritize resource allocation, and potentially improve the efficiency of service delivery. This project demonstrates the importance of data analysis in enhancing customer service and decision-making processes within the public sector.
